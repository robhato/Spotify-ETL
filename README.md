## Spotify ETL Util Scripts

This repo contains a few sample util scripts which have been used to pull some data from my Spotify account (like recent songs, playlist songs, artists, genres, etc..), clean them, and import them into a sqlite database.

I ustilizied the spotipy library to eliminate some of the overhead involved with accessing the Spotify API.

Personally, I'll be using this as a base for later projects, but for now it's just the bare minimum :)

## TODO:

- [ ] Create a requirements.txt for ease of package installation
- [ ] Add user information to env file
- [ ] Add extra functions maybe??
